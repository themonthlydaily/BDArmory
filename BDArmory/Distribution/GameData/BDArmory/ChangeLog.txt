	- Increase the HP of the combat seat to the same as a kerbal (500).
	- Add a time scaling option to the GamePlay section of the settings for speeding up/slowing down the game rate while competitions are active.
		- This does not affect the physics time-step, which remains at 0.02, but simply tries to make the in-game clock go faster with respect to a wall clock, so it should not affect the physics (if they're implemented correctly).
		- WARNING: This is likely to mess with any other mod that adjusts the time rate, e.g., TimeControl, if they're active at the same time.
		- WARNING: Consistency of the results (compared to running at normal speed) is not yet verified, but initial results look promising.
- Internal:
	- Add the script for evaluating the score weights and the old dmg_analysis (for .50cal, 20mm and 30mm ammo) to '_Other Stuff'.
	- Remove executable status of the vessel-trace plotting script.
	- Replace hard-coded layer mask numbers in raycasts and similar with bitwise combinations of the LayerMasks enum. Many of these raycast include questionable/unknown layers.

	- Add logic for planes in Follow mode for the period between taking off and reaching their min altitude.
	- Add unclamped values for the low- and high-speed steer limiters.
- Weapons:
	- Move finalFire checks into a single function that runs in AimAndFire during the FashionablyLate timing phase instead of being spread between Update and FixedUpdate.
	- Add check to AI when using a weapons group to grab the lead offset from a weapon that can fire (has ammo/not reloading/overheated/pointing at self), not merely the first weapon found.
	- Reduce spin up times for Vulcan/Gaus.
	- Fix shrapnel radius of missiles/bombs/shells using standard warheads.

- Fix cost of aluminum armor panels.
- Fueltanks will no longer randomly explode when shot.

	- An updated continuous spawning log parser.
	- Adjust the ballistic trajectory simulation time-step multiplier based on the distance to the target to give improved debug lines/targeting line visuals.
	- Armor Panels now use Armor Integrity instead of HP.
	- Nukes now support custom FX.
- AI:
	- Also avoid 0 altitude (terrain avoidance) for bodies without solid surfaces or oceans (i.e., Jool).
	- Reworked the integral component of the PID to work as an actual PID again:
		- The integral is no longer reset to 0 when the pitch error changes sign, nor decays with time.
		- The integral is now vector valued to account for coupling between the yaw and pitch axes due to roll and the individual pitch and yaw components are projected out from this integral.
		- The maximum contribution to the steering from the integral component is 1 (similar to the magnitude of the individual components before this change, but larger than the original 0.2 prior to the previous change).
		- The internal yaw damping factor is increased from 0.2 to 0.33 to keep the internal ratios between the axes consistent for each of the P, I and D components (1:0.33:0.1 for pitch:yaw:roll).
	- Use missile velocity vector for evasion instead of missile relative position to prevent turning into missiles when they are at close range. 
	- Use soonest time to closest approach instead of closest distance to select highest threat missile. 
	- Change closest approach point to ignore missile threats to 3 Blast Radius from 1.5 Blast Radius.

v1.4.6.0
FIXES
	- Store the armed/IFF state in the craft files instead of just the GUI strings.

		- Regenerate exhaust prefab object pools when they're detected to contain nulls due to scene changes or reloads.
		- Trigger missile exhaust prefab detachment on part.OnJustAboutToDie and OnDestroy as well.
	- Add KeyNotFound and NRE checks in CheckForMissingParts.

	- Remove arc length term from DLZ calculation for ground launched missiles (this was breaking VLS parts).

IMPROVEMENTS
	- Missile evasion:
		- Behavior changes to notch and dive against missiles, pull away before impact for heat seekers only (continuing to notch is more effective against radar missiles). Fix spinning in place behavior that had occurred occasionally.
		- Simplify entry conditions for missile evasion behavior (only occurs within threshold of when your craft is set to dispense chaff/flares regardless of whether it has chaff or flares onboard).
		- Proper throttle settings for chaffing vs flaring.
		- Add check if radar missiles are still boresighted towards craft as a condition to treat missiles as a threat.
	- Shift 'AimAndFireAtEndOfFrame' to occur during the FashionablyLate timing phase of FixedUpdate and rename it 'AimAndFire'. This synchronises firing with the physics instead of waiting until the scene is rendered. It also occurs before Krakensbane adjustments have been made.
	- Simplify target threat to either be 0 (not under attack) or 1 (under attack).
	- Make Kerbal Safety a slider instead of a toggle to allow disabling ejection from cockpits, but still have existing kerbalEVAs deploy parachutes.
	- Add 'Start Comp. NOW Delay' slider for automatically triggering 'Start Competition NOW' after a given delay.
	- Tournament results parser:

	- Return a full list of incoming missiles sorted by distance in UpdateGuardViewScan instead of just the first found.
	- Convert 'under attack' and 'under fire' routines to maintain their state until 1s after last notification instead of simply resetting after a fixed period.
	- Adds Impulse/Gravitc functionality for ballistics/rockets/lasers
		- Adds some new configuration fields
			- impulseWeapon = foo //gun/laser will deal impulse instead of damage
			- Impulse = n //magnitude of impulse delivered per bullet/rocket/pulse laser shot, and impulse/sec delivered by beam lasers. setting this negative will make attractor lasers instead of repulsor lasers
			- graviticWeapon = foo //gun/laser will temporarily modify mass of hit part
			- massAdjustment = n //mass, in tons, added per sec by beams or per hit by bullets/rockets/pulselasers
		- Adds some new rocketdef config options
			- gravitic = foo //rocket will temporarily modify weight of parts hit by rocket and its explosion
			- impulse = foo //rocket applies non-damaging impulse to parts hit by rocket/explosion
			- choker = foo //rocket will temporarily disable air intakes caught in its blast radius
			- EMP = foo //rocket will apply EMP buildup to targets within blast radius

	- Multitarget fix
	- Chernobyl bugfixes
	- Various NRE fixes

IMPROVEMENTS
	- Separate bullet movement and collision detection into separate functions. Detect collisions in the initial frame of a bullet so point blank shots work.
	- Detect exit collision with objects when the barrel of the gun is within the object's collider, i.e., sub-point-blank shots.
	- Added a slider for configuration of specific RWP rounds.

	- Remove null-coalescing operators from Monobehaviours as they don't work in Unity.
	- Multi-Target barrage fix: weapons targeting a target outside their fire arc will now be skipped instead of bringing the barrage to a halt until the offending weapon can be brought to bear.

IMPROVEMENTS
	- Added a few more interesting spawning points (currently requires removing the old spawn_locations.cfg file in order to update, this will be changed soon).
	- Re-work rocket damage to do kinetic damage and penetrate armour and correctly report scoring info.

	- Small optimisation in explosion book-keeping.
	- Increase maximum firing angle to 4 in both the weapon and the weapon manager.

	Kerbal Safety:
	- Ejection from cockpits and cabins is now working. Note: ejecting lots (>100) of kerbals simultaneously can cause KSP to freeze for several minutes.
	- Set random rotation and torque to ejected kerbals. Disable collisions while manually moving the EVA kerbal.
	- Let the Kraken eat kerbals that get invalid positions (NaN). Note: this doesn't appear to be an issue now due to the fix above.
	- Self-destruct action group for WM (helps with testing things).
	- Remove the kerbals' jetpacks to save 45kg.

	Parsing script:
	- Add default interpreter (for Linux) to parsing script.

	- Disable (missing) legacy code analysis tools in .csproj.
IMPROVEMENTS
	- Explosive damage penetration:
		- Basic explosive damage penetration handling. Parts closer to the explosion are ablated first with a small amount of bleed through for relatively weak parts.

			- Prioritize weapons that are within their firing angle.
			- Adjust weapon prioritisation of being within firing angle for firing angle scaling with target size and distance.
		- Added VIPs, which allow you to set up behavior such as guarding your VIP, or attacking enemy VIPs and ignoring craft defending them.
			- Add new "Is VIP" toggle to the weapons manager. Allows you to set a craft as a "VIP" which opens up new target priority options.
			- Added new target priority options "Protect My VIPs" and "Attack Enemy VIPs". Setting positive values on these sliders will result in the craft targeting enemies that are targeting VIPs on its own team, or attacking enemy VIPs, respectively.
		- Don't try to engage torpedoes with guns/missiles/lasers.
		- Use other weapons for ground targets if missiles fired is greater than or equal to max missiles on target setting.
		- Don't use arc length calculation for torpedo DLZ since they can turn much more quickly in water than airborne missiles.

	- Fix BDRotaryRail stack overflow and give warning if the conditions that gave rise to it occur again.
	- Put chute into right state before deploying it with WM AG.
	- Don't assign gender to spawned kerbals, let KSP do it.
	- Fix CheckSafeToFireGuns for debris preventing firing due to being too close to the target.
	- Reduced (but not eliminated) exceptions due to comet vessels.
	- Change the minimum damage amount of 0.01 to 0 as this was the cause of the fire damage over time applying despite the game being paused or slowed with time control.
	- Fix NREs in explosions from ClusterBomb.cs
	- Add KSP version dependent checks for part.IsKerbalEVA and crew.ResetInventory.
	- Updates Rocket targeting, fixes aimer alignment
	- Updates laser Infos with proper resource usage
IMPROVEMENTS
	UI and quality-of-life tweaks:
	- Add fault tolerance for missing bullet defs in GetInfo.
	- Add similar handing of missing or broken rocket info as for bullet info.
	- Move ConfigNode functions to their own translation unit.
	- Add 'Clear Debris Now' and 'Clear Bystanders Now' buttons to the Vessel Spawner window (in Spawn Options).
	- Option for using the old format of the Vessel Switcher window ('t'). Option for reassigning teams on spawn or retaining the original team name defined in the SPH.

	- Teams options in the spawning and local tournament settings, including custom serialisation (doesn't support commas in craft file names) and UI adjustments.
	- Configure how seats are filled in the Vessel Spawner Window: minimal, all control points, also cabins. Crewed weapons always get filled with 1 crew.
	- Option to reset maxHitPoints on vessels loaded into flight mode (e.g., during spawning). Uses the MM patched value if available.
	- More consistent addition of _1, _2, etc., to vessel names which should make teams of the same vessel have valid results summaries in many cases without having to rename each craft (which is still a better solution!), not just the files.
	- Add RESULT line to competition log to indicate overall result of the competition (needed for teams).
	- Updated format of log files for teams. Updated tournament parsing script.
	- Add break-down of deaths (clean Bullets, clean Missiles, clean Rams, Assists, Suicides) and kills (Bullets, Missiles, Rams), and normalised death order and death time to the results summary.
	- Set KSP version of SpawnProbe to 1.9.0 to avoid issues with spawning on older installations.
	Kerbal Safety:
	- Move kerbal safety code from autonomous combat seat check in BDACompetition.cs to KerbalSafety.cs with its own toggle.
	- Free-falling kerbals deploy parachutes.
	- Kerbals in falling command seats leave the seat.
	- Vessels (and kerbals therein) are recovered during spawning instead of getting destroyed.
	- Surviving kerbals are recovered and immediately available for flying in the next competition instead of being MIA.
	- Ejection from cockpits is still a WIP.
	Battle Damage:
	- Battle damage is now configurable with multiple sub-categories, with the following toggles. Per-hit proc chance is also adjustable.
	- Fuel Tanks
		- FuelTanks will now leak when hit
		- Tanks may be configured to be self-sealing, trading some fuel capacity for leak resistance
		- Tank leak rate and leak duration can be adjusted
	- Ammo Boxes
		- Ammo boxes will potentially explode if hit
		- Ammo Boxes can be set to explode when destroyed
		- Adds ModuleCASE to ammo parts. Caselevel can be set from 0-2, higher levels reduce ammo explosion damage, at the cost of increased mass and cost.
	- Engines
		- Engine thrust reduced when hit, will start leaking fuel/catch fire/shut down when badly damaged
		- Intakes performance reduced when hit
		- Engine Gimbals can fail when hit
	- Wings
		- Wing damage per hit reduced
		- Wing lift loss capped at 50% total lift
		- Wing damage per hit is now configurable
		- Ailerons can fail when hit
	- Subsystems
		- Subsystem components
		- SAS/Radar/etc can be disabled when hit
	- Command
		- Control damage when hit
		- Pilots can be killed from cockpit damage
	- Fires - if a tank is leaking fuel, chance for leak to ignite
		- Fire damage over time
		- Fires in cockpits or other crewed or crew adjacent parts will be automatically extinguished.
		- Adds ModuleSelfSealingTank, can be toggled to prevent tanks leaks until tank receives substantial damage. it also adds the ability to configure fueltanks and engines to carry firebottles to extinguish fires
	RCS:
	- Improved RCS calculation accuracy and speed, your craft's RCS may be slightly different from 1.4.0.7
	- Recalculate RCS occasionally when parts are lost (to account for damage or missiles firing)
	- Fix engine afterburner textures affecting RCS calculation (was an issue for Tiger and Cheetah engines from AirplanePlus)
	Missiles:
	- New variables that affect heat seeking missile performance: lockedSeekerFOVBias, and lockedSeekerVelocityBias. See Sidewinder config file for more details.
	- Fixed allAspect and maxOffBoresight to work as intended. Vertical launch systems (VLS) and high off-boresight missiles should work as intended. See AIM-120 config file for details.
	- Add ability for Air-to-Ground missiles to lead targets based on their velocity.
	- Fixed Dynamic Launch Zone calculation, should result in more close-range missile fires and high off-boresight missiles only firing when they are likely to hit their target.
	- Better explanation of what missile parameters do added to Sidewinder and AIM-120 config files (new heat seeker value description in Sidewinder config file).
	- Updated torpedo tuning from Kurgan.

	- Improvements to RCS/stealth/ECM:
		- Craft with a lower modified radar signature (from ECM Modules that reduce signature) no longer have increased lock range. The range at which craft are locked will be accurate based on the RCS Window in the SPH/VAB if no jammers are used.
		- Re-worked RCS system. Calculate 95 azimuth/elevation pairs across 0-180 deg Az, 23 to -23 deg El, take the 3rd quartile of the distribution to use as the total RCS.
		- Scale RCS up by 4 to better match reality and provide better balancing against stock radars.
		- Display worst three Az/El pairs in the BDA editor window so that users can improve their design.
		- Fix to turn on all ECM jammers when an incoming radar-missile is detected.
	- Improvements to missiles:
		- Allow firing multiple missiles at the same radar target without losing radar lock. Firing missiles at multiple locked targets needs considerable work to be feasible.
		- Fix known issues with terminal guidance.
		- Add option for configuring FireFOV of a turret (fires when pointing within this angle of target). Reduce step size of fire interval to 0.5s.
	- Improvements to pilot AI:
		- Allow users to set "Firing Angle," the angle the weapons are within of being on target before firing. Default is 1 deg. Setting is on Weapons Manager. Setting only affects weapons with a yaw and pitch range of less than 5 degrees for both axes.
		- Make wing commander 'spread' and 'lag' values persistent.
		- Allow pilots in the "Attack" command to evade if they are being fired at by another craft
		- Sliders for controlling threshold and period of collision avoidance between vessels.
		- Allow craft to evade if they are under attack while being commanded to "Attack."
	- UI improvements:

	- Kerbals in falling combat seats eject to safety.
	- Deploy halo chute for falling kerbals. Add AG to WM to deploy chutes on external kerbals.

v1.3.8.1
FIXES

	- Reduce max fireBurstLength to 10 and stepIncrement to 0.05 to allow more control of gun burst length.
	- Updated HP patch from CeruleanEyes

v1.3.8

		- Fixed decals not being returned to the object pool so that they work efficiently now.
	Other fixes:
		- Use the correct spawn distance value in the remote orchestration.
		- Unity's fake nulls strike again: properly reset explosion object pools on scene changes.
		- KSP is labelling some missiles as debris. Detect these and don't remove them.
		- Bugfixes, memory leak fixes and optimisations.
		- Don't use Parallel.ForEach to update ramming information as Unity doesn't like get_transform being called from threads.
		- Assign font attributes in Awake instead of Constructor.
		- Fix potential NRE in ApplyDamage in PooledBullet.cs
		- Fix a potential NRE in continuous spawning where a spawned vessel gets destroyed before it's activated.
		- Fix special case of vessels with combat seats getting renamed.
		- Reset spawn position and rotation after spawning as sometimes KSP packs and unpacks craft and resets things!
		- Wait an extra update during spawning to allow reference transforms to be assigned.
		- Use altitudes from FlightGlobals when raycasting fails during spawning.
IMPROVEMENTS
	Main improvements:
		- Rebalance of explosion damage from bullets to approximate the previous DPS of the browning, vulcan and gau-8.
		- AI/WM now cost 0.
	Other improvements:

		- Add configurable keybindings for tournament setup and running. Improve layout of 'Edit Inputs' window.
		- Added an 'auto-enable vessel-switching' option to general settings. Added 'auto' mode for tournament generation that chooses an appropriate number of vessels per heat and distributes the deficit over multiple heats.
		- Set up paintball decal pools when the paintball toggle is toggled.
		- Extra damage sliders in-game
		- Small optimisation to avoid reallocating Ray instance in PooledBullet.cs
		- Add the explModelPath to the browninganm2.cfg
		- Use a split slider for tournament rounds setting to allow up to 100 rounds.
		- Reuse deathOrder variable instead of fetching it from BDACompetitionMode.Instance again.
		- Use minSpeed instead of idleSpeed in steer limiter. Scale possibleAccel by 1/15 as before (but without G) for now until we find a better solution.
		- Additional regular check for vessels renamed as planes due to the combat seat.
		- Automatically end a continuous spawning competition when there's nothing left to spawn and <2 active craft.
		- Add a max altitude GM killer.
		- Updated Python scripts for parsing competition results logs.
		- Also trigger competition end when there's only 1 team left.
		- Include engine acceleration but not gravity in GetSteerLimiterForSpeedAndPower as it makes gliders and RegainEnergy work better.
		- Use afterburners when regaining energy.
		- Trigger the target scan after all the teams have been assigned.
		- Enable target priority by default.
		- Stop extending when changing targets.
		- Include death time and normalised death order in web orchestration reporting with surviving player death order/time set to max

v1.3.6.3
FIXES
	- Don't autodestruct missiles if the explosive parts are using the override.
	- Show message about why the vessel spawning timed out.
	- Prevent windows from being competely off-screen (the drag region may still be off-screen though). Toggling "Strict Window Boundaries" will bring all the windows onto the screen if you can't find them.
IMPROVEMENTS
	- Absolute Distance vs Distance Factor toggle and expanded Spawn Distance slider for ranges up to 20km. (Note: for distances over 10km, it struggles due to the PRE and terrain. Using an airborne spawn first can help fix this.)

  * Increased maximum allowable missles per target to 18, up from 6.
  * Added EMP Module.  Now Electromagnetic pulses exist in game that can disable electronics within the blast range.
  * Added 2 new EMP equipped missiles  HellFire EMP, and AIM-120 EMP.  Small pulse radius but demonstrates the feature.
  * Added 3 different sized EMP pulse FX, allows for additional sized pulse weapons.
  * Added Reloadable Missile Rail (ModuleMissileRearm.  Now missile launchers can be reloadable!  
	This module can be added to missile launcher designs to allow reloading. (code used with permission courtesy of @flywyx).  
	Requires unity based modifications,  normal rails will not function as reloadable unless additional transforms are added.
  * Added new standard resource High Explosive.  Provides better matching of tntMass for balance.
  * Added an Ammo switcher feature (no more Firespitter required)
  * Added new Universal Ammo Box part that uses the new Ammo switcher feature.  Old part remains for backawards compatability.  
	Use the new part going forward.  To remove the need for FireSpitter, replace existing Ammo Box parts with the new part on existing craft.
  * Improved sub categories for BDA parts.  This helps with the clutter in the Editor under the BDA category.
  * Removed BDACategoryModule as a result of the BDA categories refactor.  
	Existing craft may see a module not found warnings in the log.  This will have no ill effects and can be safely ignored.
  * Improved smoke effects for smoke canister launchers
  * Added new Jet engine based on the J-404.  Licensed from KTech. (Thanks @TheKurgan, @SpannerMonkey(SMCE) & @XOC2008!)
  * Added new BDAc Test Drone MKIII craft, utilizing the new engine.

v1.0.0

* NEW FEATURES:

  * Radar & Stealth, re-design of how the radar system works:
	- New radar reflection shader (credit: original great idea by JR!), calculating cross section in m^2:
	   + allows building for stealth using angled surfaces (“scatter those pesky radar waves away!”)
	   + calculation is normalized so that a 1x1 structural plate directly frontally facing the radar yields a return of exactly 1 m^2
	- Redesign of the radar system, radars all have different ranges & detection performance:
	   + radar part configs changed, new fields (floatcurves) to define detection and lock/track performance, new field to specify ground clutter effectiveness
	- New in-editor analysis window to help evaluate a craft’s cross section and performance against selectable radars
	- New options for configuration of radar guided missiles in the part config:
	   + can now explicitly specify active seeker performance (via a FloatCurve, similar to radars)
	   + can now explicitly specify the static radar cross section of a missile for detection purpose
	- Adjustment of the Chaff countermeasure system: more gradual effect of decoying missiles away (instead of previous “all-or-nothing”)
	- Adjustment of IR missiles and flare countermeasures: simulating now more of a “imaging infrared” seeker than an old dumb seeker – to be successfully decoyed, flares have to more closely match the thermal spectrum of the part the seeker has locked on to

  * Massive improvements to ballistic missile guidance and modular missiles, ability to simulate ICBM flight paths:
	- Ballistic guidance has been enhanced to allow firing missiles accurately even at distances greater than 500 km
	- A new field called BallisticOverShootFactor has been added to missiles, the greater the value the further the missile will go before the terminal maneuver begins
	- By default all missiles now can steer in vacuum. New field called "vacuumSteerable" can be set to false to disable this behaviour    
	- Auto SAS activation when the missile is fired. Before it was only activated if the parent vessel had it switched on.
	- Improved the Cruise and Ballistic Guidance. Ballistic Guidance will switch to AGM guidance as soon as it reached the 50% of the distance
	- Guard mode in space will consider orbiting vessels as "flying" (air targets), hence engagement of space targets is possible now
 
  * New dedicated sonar ping and torpedo ping sounds, courtesy of PapaJoe!

* FIXES / ENHANCEMENTS:

  * Localization updates, including chinese localization (thanks @ACEA)
  * Fixed indestructible Kerbals - weapons/explosions have effect on Kerbals again! (thanks @Designer225)
  * Fixed AIPilot problem with drag estimations (thanks @RichardDastardly)
  * Fix missile infinite fuel
  * Fix rwr window invisible in fresh installs
  * Display ranges of RWR and radar display now linked, selectable display range of radar display up to configured PRE physics max range!
  * Window position saving also for vesselswitcher
  * Prevent active radar missiles locking onto anything they see, now obey engagement settings
  * Sonar pings and torpedos only show on RWR if vessel is splashed/submerged
  * Fix guard mode "cheating" - now must have detected an enemy with radar/sonar or with visual range before it can attack it
  * If a cruise missile has terminal guidance, it can be switched off (before launch) in the part action window. The missile will then be purely gps guided without engaging its terminal targeting mode
  * If debug labels are enabled, upon entering the editor all bda parts & their properties (if relevant for balancing) are dumped into .csv files for convenient analysis in excel
  * Complete review of all event handlers, should reduce some actual or potential nullrefs upon explosive vessel disassembly
  * General performance improvements due to code refactoring

* New Parts

	* Courtesy of SpannerMonkey 
		- BDA MK1 Sonar Pod
		- Sting Ray  BDA LightWeight Torpedo
		
* Notes on Naval Combat Features

	* Current implementation of "Sonar" reuses the current Radar code. Future state will have dedicated windows and naming convention
	* Activating a "Sonar" pod still says "Activate Radar"
	* A Sonar is defined by setting the rwrThreatType = 6
		- Sonar rules
			- Will only detect vessels that are underwater (> 20meters)
			- Sonar will not function if vessel is in flight
			- Sonar does not detect "Landed" vessels, only splashed
			- Normal Radar does not detect underwater vessels, still detects "Splashed" i.e. Boats
	* Engagment type "SLW" only targets underwater (submarines) and Splashed (Boats)
