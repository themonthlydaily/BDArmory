IMPROVEMENTS / FIXES
- General:
	- Fix part filtering by search terms in the editors.
	- Fix Krakensbane adjustments when the active vessel dies.
	- Fix tracer visuals when the active vessel dies.
	- Adjust timing and conditions for auto-camera switching to and away from missiles.
	- Battle damage fuel leak rates now scale by (bullet caliber)^2, instead of (bullet caliber). Fuel leak rates for 20mm caliber remain the same, calibers higher and lower than 20mm will now have higher and lower leak rates, respectively.
- UI:
	- New Opacity option in BDA Team Icons to set icon opacity.
- AI / WM:
	- Invert the roll target when the fly-to direction is below and behind the craft within the Immelmann turn angle.
	- Fix automatic gun range adjustments in the WM again.
	- Prevent Orbital AI from changing attitude while launched missile is still near spacecraft.
- Weapons:
	- Corrections to penetration and ricochet velocity changes and ricochet positions.
	- Stop APS firing at dead missiles.
	- 'subProjectileCount' has been deprecated and replaced with 'projectileCount'; this specifies number of pellets per shot (for shotguns, etc) to make it more intuitive. Existing shotgun-type weapons will need to update their bulletDefs.
	- The subMunitionType field for beehive ammo now uses the syntax of "ammotype; quantity" (e.g. subMunitionType = 35x228AHEADPellet; 30) with number of projectiles released on detonation set here instead of the subMunition's bulletDef.
	- Fix the aiming reticles of guns (fixed and turrets) and auto-proxy-tracking when using MouseAimFlight (again).
	- Missiles:
		- Fix issue with Rotary Rails trying to use missiles that have previously been blown off from combat damage.
		- Fix issue with MultiMissilelauncher Turrets throwing an NRE when AI firing.
		- Fix mass changes of missiles that decouple boosters and add missile mass debug telemetry.
		- Fix radar and heat targeting leading targets excessively (most apparent in orbit).

		- Fix AI occasionally not firing radar missiles; Git Issue #573.
		- Change spacing missiles with continous rod warheads from Detonation Distance / 3 to  Min(Blast Radius / 3, Detonation Distance / 3).
		- Fix missile RCS FX constantly displaying.
		- Missiles with RCS/Orbital homing types (i.e. HEKV) in vacuum now perform turn maneuver after launch to face target and only throttle up once facing target.
		- Add new dragArea configuration variable for missiles to set reference area for drag independently from the lift area. If not set, this defaults to the liftArea setting in the missile configuration file.
		- Added missile g-limiting. Now you can set a missile maximum g-limit using the "gLimit" field. Additionally a "gMargin" field exists which allows you to specify an allowable margin the missile can miss by to optimize drag. I.E. the missile is allowed to pull only gLimit - gMargin if pulling gLimit will result in too much drag.
		- Corrected pronav and augpronav normal acceleration using the g-limiting feature
		- Improved missile turning behavior, turns should be slightly smoother overall.
		- Added Kappa guidance, an optimal type of midcourse guidance for in-atmosphere missiles. This re-uses the LoftAngle, LoftMaxAltitude and LoftRangeOverride fields, though LoftRangeOverride is now the range where the missile will switch from lofting to the midcourse guidance. Introduces a new field, "kappaAngle" which is a trajectory shaping angle, higher values mean a steeper terminal trajectory.
		- Fixed missile contact detonation logic, a bug was present which lead to inaccurate detection of missile contact
		- Improved AAMLoft performance against maneuvering targets

- Countermeasures:
	- Add vessel's velocity to chaff ejection particle effect.
	- Use vessel acceleration instead of velocity for chaff decoy factor calculation when in space.
	- Add option in WM's CM settings for auto-deploying CMs when not in guard mode (e.g., for manual combat).

		- Incorporate missile frontAspectHeatModifier value into missile selection logic so rear-aspect missiles are not selected if they cannot be fired.
- Competition:
	- Include last-damaged-by tracking for bullet explosions that damage vessels, not just hits.

	- Fix an NRE related to jammers enabling.
- Competition:
	- Make the saving of backup tournaments optional (hidden setting TOURNAMENT_BACKUPS in settings.cfg).

		- Ranked tournaments begin with a single shuffled round (craft assigned to heats randomly), then continues to generate ranked rounds (craft assigned to heats based on their current rank) until the number of ranked rounds run matches or exceeds the rounds slider (which can be adjusted during a tournament).
		- Ranked tournaments only work for FFA style tournaments. nCr and gauntlet style tournaments aren't supported.
		- For teams tournaments, the combined score for the teams is used for the ranking.
		- Enable the score window via the "Sc" button on the Vessel Switcher window.
		- Use the "UI" button to keep the window visible even when the rest of the UI is disabled (F2).
		- Use the "±" buttons to adjust the font size.

	- Fix a minor bug in the tournament log parsing script where wins weren't always being counted for the score.
	- Make the saving of backup tournaments optional (hidden setting in settings.cfg).
	- Add NPC support for FFA-RNG tournaments (both ranked and non-ranked).
		- To use NPCs, create a "NPCs" folder in the folder for the tournament (e.g., "AutoSpawn/MyTournament/NPCs"), add the NPC files to this folder, then set the "NPCs Per Heat" slider to the desired number of NPCs.
		- NPC files will be reused as necessary to provide the appropriate number of randomly selected NPCs each heat.
		- When generating heats, the number of NPCs is taken into account for the total number of vessels per heat (e.g., 8 vessels per heat with 2 NPCs per heat would give 6 players + 2 NPCs in each heat).
		- The "Tournament Scores" window will only show the scores for non-NPCs.
	- Add an "auto" setting for the "Vessels Per Team Per Heat" in teams tournaments where the teams will simply be all the craft files in each team's folder.
- Detectors
	- Add settings toggle ASPECTED_RCS that enables real-time RCS evaluation based on the target aircraft's azimuth and elevation relative to the radar evaluating it.
		- Enable from the BDA settings menu under Missile & CM settings: "Real-Time Aspected RCS."
		- The real-time aspected RCS is dependent on a weighted average against overall craft RCS, so lower overall craft RCS will lead to better aspected RCS.
		- Overall craft RCS weighting in this average is dependent on ASPECTED_RCS_OVERALL_RCS_WEIGHT = 0.25 in the settings.cfg file.
		- Final aspected RCS will be = (1-ASPECTED_RCS_OVERALL_RCS_WEIGHT) * [Aspected RCS] + ASPECTED_RCS_OVERALL_RCS_WEIGHT * [Overall RCS].
	- RWRs now activate when they first detect a missile instead of when missile enters visual range.

- AI:
	- Adjustments to terrain avoidance defaults and how the threat range is calculated for better default terrain avoidance.
	- Add a slider for setting the angular size of the cone for performing an Immelmann turn, in which the craft will simply pitch up to turn to a target in that direction.

- AI:
	- Fix incorrect terrain avoidance critical angle conversion (degrees vs radians).
	- Add a slider for setting the control surface deployment time used for terrain avoidance and reduce the amount the control surface deployment time affects the terrain detection distance.
		- Note: the default is now lower than it was before and lowering it further can significantly reduce the terrain avoidance distance for highly manoeuverable craft.

v1.5.9.1
IMPROVEMENTS / FIXES
- General:
	- Adjust how PartsBlacklist.cfg is read/written to merge the defaults with any existing custom values.
	- Fix known exceptions and NaNs.
- Weapons:
	- Use the combination of DEBUG_LINES and DEBUG_WEAPONS for showing the targeting component debug lines instead of only having them in the debug build.
	- Further tweaks to the aim assist targeting reticle to account for the floating origin.
	- Missiles/Bombs now arm their warheads when they reach a safe distance from their launching craft, to prevent anti-missile systems fragging craft by detonating ordinance immediately after launch.
- UI:
	- Add a toolbar button for the BDA Vessel Mover.
	- Make window states persistent across scene changes.
- Competition:
	- Remove drag from seated Kerbals in the Waypoint race gamemode.

v1.5.9.0
IMPROVEMENTS / FIXES
- General:
	- Blacklist the PotatoRoid due to it not having a valid prefab (they get procedurally generated) and causing NREs.
	- Add try-catch around setting the gear action group due to the FSM sometimes breaking it and breaking pilot initialisation.
	- Remove HP rounding and lower HP limit for MM-patched parts. Apply health modifier after applying rounding and lower HP limit for non-MM-patched parts.
	- Add Infinite Propellant and Infinite Electricity Gamemode toggles to BDA settings menu.
	- Some minor debug message cleanup.
	- Updated German localisation from EzBro.
	- Add Vessel Mover functionality directly in BDA:
		- Spawning:
			- Choice of classic or custom vessel selection:
				- Classic is the built-in vessel selection window (slow to load, but gives more details).
				- Custom is faster and remembers the scroll position.
			- Crew selection (optional):
				- The chosen crew are added to the spawned vessel in the order selected, up to the capacity of the vessel.
				- If the "Fill Seats" option in the Vessel Spawner window is set to "Minimal", then only the selected crew are used, otherwise the remaining crew slots are filled with random kerbals.
				- Option to create or remove kerbals from the roster (excluding Jeb, Val, Bill and Bob).
			- Spawning uses BDA's spawning routines:
				- Corrects for badly sorted part trees in craft files.
				- Mostly fixes staging sequences (some parts, such as parachutes, still don't stage properly).
				- Aligns craft with terrain/scenery normals based on control point orientation and facility the craft was built in.
				- Default spawn orientation matches that of the KSC runway or launchpad, depending on which facility the craft was built in.
		- Moving:
			- Movement and rotation speeds scale with altitude instead of at preset speeds.
			- Movement and rotation have a ramping up period to allow for fine adjustments.
			- Movement automatically maintains altitude AGL but will adjust to avoid buildings and other craft.
			- Movement coordinates are relative to the local coordinate frame with forward aligning with the camera. In map mode, forward is aligned with north.
			- Tab/Shift+Tab jumps to preset altitudes (50km, 10km, 1km, 100m, 10m / minimum safe), 'x' jumps to the minimum safe altitude, other keybinds are the same as for the VesselMover mod (see the help button).
			- Vessels are lowered to the terrain and then eased in for up to 10s to allow them to settle.
			- Vessels can be dropped.
			- Option for setting the minimum lowering speed.
			- Options for enabling brakes/SAS when lowered.
			- Option for placing vessels on terrain below water (also affects terrain following while moving).
			- Option for placement-lowering (jump to safe height, then lower the rest of the way).
			- Option for not worrying about colliding with stuff (for getting really close to things for screenshots).
			- Movement indicator scales with the vessel's radius (+2m).
		- Movement and spawning don't require the active vessel to be landed.
		- Includes a button to recover the active vessel (i.e., remove it) from flight.
		- Doesn't conflict with the VesselMover mod, but actively using both at the same time may cause weird interactions.
		- Limitations:
			- Sometimes, when moving beyond the limits of PRE, KSP can break due to automatic vessel switching.
			- If the mouse is over a window when moving, the camera often lags behind (this is likely due to krakensbane and may be fixable).
			- The camera may act weirdly if CameraTools is enabled while moving a vessel (also likely due to krakensbane).
- UI:
	- Add a keybind for targeting the next GPS target.
	- Add labels to the vessel switcher score entries for rockets, missiles, rams and tag.
	- Parts with zero lift now appear as grey in the lift visualizer.
	- Fix issues with wing stacking calculation. Calculation now returns ratio of non-separated vertically stacked lift area to total lift area (capped at 100%). Wings spaced sufficiently apart will not contribute to the stacking value.
	- Add option "Camera Switch: Incl. Missiles" to switch to and follow a missile fired by the active vessel until it explodes or misses (requested from FJRT, requires CameraTools v1.27.0 for optimal behaviour).
	- Add whitelist option for guns/rockets/lasers to report hits in the competition marquee.
	- Fix manual aim assist UI placement for fixed weapons.
- AI / WM:
	- AI will start evading missiles once the missile engine activates instead of waiting for 1 second after launch.
	- When orbiting, adjust altitude for terrain variation when below 1000m and account for terrain in the way when below 500m.
	- Remove the 'premature dive fix', which causes weird flight behaviour when flying inverted.
	- Terrain avoidance improvements:
		- When avoiding terrain and roll is inverted by more than the critical angle (default 120°), reverse the roll target so that terrain avoidance is done while fully inverted and enable Aiming steer mode for more yaw control.
		- Remove the terrain avoidance cool-down period for faster recovery after avoiding terrain.
		- Restrict the avoidance radius (default is twice the "radius" of the vessel) to the min altitude to allow cruising at min altitude despite without triggering terrain avoidance.
		- Include all detected colliders in the terrain avoidance path and use a weighted average of normals to determine the appropriate terrain avoidance direction to fly (this helps with avoiding buildings).
		- Remove the secondary raycast for upcoming terrain as it doesn't seem necessary and is doubtful it was helping.
		- Adjust the max deflection for avoiding terrain to be based on the maxAoA clamped to within 45° and 70°.
- Armor / Materials:
	- Steel Hull Material melting point increased.
	- Fix issue with armor panels potentially spalling away more than the entire volume of the plate and getting instantly deleted.
- Countermeasures:
	- Add selection priority to countermeasures to allow staggering of dropping countermeasures — higher priority CM dispensers trigger first.
- GameModes:
	- Add ability to disable cornering multiplier when using space hacks by setting it to 0. 
	- Space Friction no longer applied to root part at the position of the CoM; large craft whould have an easier time turning now.

	- Fix ammo count in WM GUI for reloadable missiles.
	- AI will now properly respect per-missile engage range when selecting and firing missiles of the same type.
- Competition:
	- Add toggle for setting maxAltitude and GM Kill limits to ASL or AGL.
	- Add Kill timer for GM Altitude to give violators a chance to get back to safe altitude instead of immediate kill.
	- Add customisable fields for the intra-team separation conditions when starting competitions (default: 800m + 100m per member) (FJRT request).
	- Add a per-round PVP score parser.
	- Fix accuracy calcs when using beehive ammo.
	- Fix vessel spawn altitude if RWP slider is set but not the RWP toggle.
- RWP:
	- Fix issue causing the web API to not report scores.
	- Tag heats run via the web API with competition, stage and heat numbers in the file names.

	- Adjust RCS scaling value to give 1 m^2 cross-section for a 1 m^2 cross-section sphere (a 25% increase). This setting was most likely previously set with MSAA enabled, so it was set incorrectly.
- Weapons:
	- Fix a bug in bullet hit calculations within the initial bullet offset distance.
	- Fix AP rounds not penetrating rear side of parts they penetrate.
	- Beehive ammo deployment range now adjustable.
	- Fix ExplosionFX spawnpoint for Shaped Charge bullets.

	- Localisation corrections/updates. Also in German.
	- Lots of optimisations.
	- Add Notes.md for devs with notes on optimisation and the current branches.

- UI:
	- Updated German localization by EzBro.
- Competition:
	- Add option to automatically disable the HUD on tournament start.
	- Fixes nukes causing hit craft to be reported as 'Crashed and Burned' in competitions.
- Spawning:
	- Fix spawning breakage due to PRE not being enabled and enable PRE checks and warnings during spawning.
	- Recover KSP's camera after spawning failure.
- Damage:
	- Fix the bug preventing explosive damage applying to buildings.
	- Rework how damage is applied to buildings and how they regenerate.
	- Add a building damage multiplier.
	- Fix reverse raycasts that were using the wrong rays.
	- Fix detonate direction in BDExplosive part, missiles/rockets with ContinuousRod/ShapedCharge warheads should now have properly oriented AoEs.
	- EMP warheads can now be set to be hard/soft EMP in their configs.
- AI / WM:
	- Add a "Debug Extending" button when AI debugging is enabled that prints extending debug info when clicked if the active vessel is extending.
	- Fix GPS missiles not obeying max missile per target setting when the target is traveling at high speeds.
	- Add an Extend Abort Time slider to the AI, where the AI will abort extending if it fails to gain distance for this amount of time. (Note: this isn't a pure timer; while not gaining distance the timer increases, but will otherwise reduce to 0 at half the rate.)
	- Add a 5s cooldown on extending if the Extend Abort Time is triggered (overriden for various extend requests, e.g., dropping bombs/nukes).
	- Dynamically update the extend distance for launching a missile while extending.
	- Limit the DLZ calculation for the extend distance for firing missiles to being maxOffBoresight off-target - avoids extreme extending distances.
	- Expand the WM's Self-Destruct AG to arm and detonate all explosive parts too.
	- Adjust the smoothing for the AoA and G-load limiting from a moving window (with a ~0.6s delay) to double exponential smoothing (with a ~0.1 delay compensated for by a 0.1s ahead prediction).
		- Note: this doesn't fix AoA/G-load limiting, it just improves the response time of its calculations.
- Detectors:
	- Random position noise due to chaff no longer scales with RCS, is instead fixed to a random number between 16 and 256.
- ECM:
	- ECM Jammer and Cloaking devices now can specify resource used when operating (default is EC).
- Weapons:
	- Fixed bug where the target velocity and acceleration was not being reset once a target was no longer tracked which resulted in lead being erroneously compensated for while mouse aiming.
	- Added ability to manually aim guns using GPS coordinates, primarily for artillery. This behavior is not a functionality in Guard Mode, however when a GPS target is manually selected, turrets will now aim to attempt to hit said target.
	- Improved shaped charge warhead behavior, now armor penetration and beyond-armor effect is much more realistic.
		- Warheads now approximately match real-world penetration performance, given the warhead size and caliber are accurate. Dual-purpose and other multi-function warheads will overperform as the equations assume all of the warhead is a shaped charge. Older and larger warheads may also overperform due to modelling being based on modern warheads.
	- Fixed issue with missile and rocket warheads where direction of blasts were not along the directions of their warheads.
	- Added "caliber" field to the BDExplosivePart module, it's an optional field for shaped charge projectiles which influences its effectiveness.
	- apBulletMod now influences shaped charge projectile penetration, modifying this allows for the penetration of shaped charge shells to be tweaked.
	- Added optional "apMod" field to the BDExplosivePart module, it's functions the same way as apBulletMod for bullets and its primary purpose is to allow users to create dual-purpose shaped charge warheads, where part of the tntMass of the warhead isn't going into the shaped charge effect, reducing penetration.
	- Added optional "apMod" field to rocket configuration file. This allows tweaking of rocket penetration, functioning the same way as apBulletMod for bullets, affecting physical armor penetration as well as shaped charge armor penetration if the rocket is equipped with a shaped charge warhead.
	- Armor protection against explosions is now influenced by angling, angling armor now makes it more difficult for the blast to punch through the armor plate.
	- Added global setting that allows for tweaking of armor effectiveness against explosion blast penetration. The higher the setting, the harder to damage parts behind armor plates via blast damage.
	- Tweaked several missiles, bullets and rockets to reflect the new shaped charge mechanics:
		- RBS-15 and RBS-15AL have had their warheads decreased from 300 kg to 200 kg to reflect their real counterparts. Added caliber field, set at 500 mm.
		- AGM-114R Hellfire missile has had its warhead decreased from 12 kg to 8 kg, with a 172 mm caliber to reflect performance estimates of earlier known models of the Hellfire. Warhead may not match -114R performance.
		- AGM-65 Maverick missile is set to have a 305 mm caliber and an apMod field added with performance set to 950 mm of penetration. No good estimates of the warhead penetration were found so an approximate estimate based on a 27 kg charge was used.
		- BGM-71 TOW missile has had its warhead decreased from 10 kg to 3.9 kg and has a 152 mm caliber to be around TOW/ITOW performance.
		- Hydra-70 has had its penetration tweaked with apMod to match estimates of the M151 HEDP warhead penetration performance.
		- AGM-86 now has caliber field, set to 620 mm.
		- Adjusted 120 mm HEAT and AP rounds to have around the same amount of penetration, balanced for gameplay (210 mm / 216 mm). Realistic configs also exist under the names "120mmBulletHEAT" and "120mmBulletSabot", a commented out line in m1Abrams.cfg can be uncommented in order to use these.
	- Offset beam-riding missile laser to the right and up from the targeting camera to mitigate issues of the camera locking on to its own missiles when on CoMLock mode, causing the targeting camera to drive missiles into the ground. Mostly affected Guard Mode behavior.
	- Fixed missile behavior with Detonation Distance set to 0, missiles should no longer phase through armor.
	- Reworks ModuleMissileRearm, now works, integrated with WM, etc.
	- Missiles with a ModuleMissileRearm can now have reloads, be affected by Infinite Ammo.
	- Adds MultiMissileLauncher module.
	- Adds new Infinite Ordinance toggle, for missiles with ModuleMissileRearm/MultiMissileLauncher.
	- Fixes NRE with APS missile interception.
	- Inaccurate or multi-shot APS (CIWS rotary cannon, etc) no longer guaranteed to kill incoming projectiles with first shot.
	- Fixes Max Turret Targets not targeting more than 2 vessels.
	- Fix Gravity gun and other impulse/gravitic laser weapons dealing damage.
	- Fix manual rocket turret aiming.
- Armor:
	- Improved hypervelocity projectile post-penetration effects. Now Whipple shields should work properly, the more spacing between the armor plates the better the performance against hypervelocity rounds.
	- Modified behavior of penetration formula below a projectile L/D ratio of 1 so penetration values are more consistent.
	- Re-added temperature effects to armor protection levels, if the armor reaches its max safe temperature or goes above said temperature, performance is degraded.
	- Added new Armor Aluminium material, based on Aluminium 7039 to provide a larger variety of armor materials to select from.
	- Adds Armor Mass Mult slider to allow tweaking armor weight in-game.
	- Armor Type "none" now disabled armor thickness slider, should fix PAW issue with 1.9.1 installs.
	- Armor Tools now displays total wing srf. area, and wingloading kg/m2.
	- Fix Armor tools mass/cost readout giving incorrect values when using global armor type.
	
v1.5.2.1

	- Add Attachnode to the Ordinance bay to fix issues with Breaking Ground Robotics.
	- Adds debugging messages to assist with making custom weapons.
	- Adds MM patch to add liftless Proc Structural Panel if B9 Pwings installed.
	- Reduce frequency (hopefully to none) of null FX object pool entries by catching unloading events too and triggering OnJustAboutToBeDestroyed before recovering vessels.
	- Allow use of the combat seat as the root part.
- UI:
	- Fix exception when resetting colours in Team Icons.
	- Prevent the kill timer from showing in the Loaded Vessel Switcher window for surface vessels.
	- Updated German localization by EzBro.
	- Adds Accuracy readout to the Weapon Debugging telemetry.
	- Setting the Armor Type to 'None' now disables the armor thickness slider; fixes PAW issue in KSP 1.9.1 installs.
- Competition:
	- Fix exception in auto-resuming tournaments when SpawnProbe.craft isn't found.
	- Fix incorrect Kill Steal attribution from 1v1 fights.
	- Abort competition if a team leader still isn't ready to engage (airborne for pilot AI) by the time the start-competition-now timer runs out.
	- Fixes AI/WM not attached to Root Part warning messages on competition start when using combat seats as the root part in RWP.
	- Add option to start competitions despite failures occuring. For tournaments, this only applies after the third attempt fails.
- Spawning:
	- Wait until after vessels are unpacked before reverting the spawn camera - fixes an exception with EVA kerbals and KSPCF.
	- Fix freezing when vessel removal throws an exception.
	- Account for wheels protruding into the ground during instant lowering of vessels.
- GameModes:
	- Space Combat Tools:
		- Better implement SpaceFriction initialization at round start.
		- Fix AI sometimes limiting to idle speed instead of max speed in space.
		- Add limits to prevent G/AoA limiter returning infinity values in space.
	- Battle Damage:
		- Add selfsealing options to Monoprop tanks.

- AI:
	- Fix incorrect inputField for off-target dynamic roll damping.
	- Fix RippleIndex Errors from weapons overheating/reloading.
	- Fix AI ignoring max missiles per target setting for GPS missiles
	- Spaceborne pilotAIs will now dodge via RCS translation.
	- Craft with guard mode enabled now automatically receive radar contacts via the datalink from friendlies if they have an onboard radar that can receive radar data (canReceiveRadarData = true in part).
	- Corrections to aiming at orbital speeds and long distances (for deep space combat).
		- Caveats:
			- There is a discontinuity in the way KSP handles floating origin/Krakensbane adjustments at 100km above each world that can adversely affect trans-100km orbit aiming slightly (high bullet speeds mostly negates this).
			- KSP won't load surface vessels when the current vessel is over ~90km (on Kerbin) for some unknown reason despite a sufficient PRE range, so orbital bombardment only works from LKO.
			- The targeting reticle currently isn't being correctly placed when manually aiming at closeby targets (will be fixed later).
- Detectors:
	- Fix IRST preventing Radar GUI close.
	- Fix NRE in targeting camera when the camera parent transform is null.
	- Re-work IR occlusion to look at engine and engine plume heat for non-prop engines, weight parts by mass and proximity to heat source for occlusion, and incorporate occlusion from the engine outside of a 50 deg angle of the engine exhaust.
	- Correct spelling of "receive" (and variants) and adjust BDA parts that use "canRecieveRadarData" to use "canReceiveRadarData" instead ("canRecieveRadarData" is retained for compatibility, but other mods should make this adjustment!).
- ECM
	- Radar missile position distortion due to chaff now relies on the ratio of ECM jammer strength to craft signature with RCS reduction to bias the position distortion from chaff to further behind the craft. Net effect is craft with jammers, and especially low RCS craft with jammers, will have an easier time evading radar missiles.
	- Lockbreak from jammers now affects RCS with RCS reduction instead of base RCS. Craft can now mix RCS reduction parts and jammers to break locks without worrying about them conflicting.
	- Incorporate stand-off jamming effects. Friendly craft with jammers now result in your craft being harder to detect and lock. Strength of this effect is determined by the lockBreakerStrength of the friendly jammers, relative distance of friendly jammers (friendly jammers closer to enemy will have a stronger effect), and if the jammers are close in field of view for the enemy (friendly jammers in same field of view will have a stronger effect). Debug readout is available by enabling the Detectors debug option.
	- AI no longer will turn off jammers automatically if they were manually enabled prior to being turned on by the AI.
- Weapons:
	- Fix FXLookAtConstraint modules on various turrets.
	- Fix incorrect charge sound path for lasers.
	- Make the ABL use proper looping audio and add a cool-down sound.
	- Fix the ABL laser beam continuing to show while overheated when used manually.
	- Fix for NRE when heatseeker is manually selected prior to activating guard mode.
	- Fix Weapon manager PAW engagement options not affecting AI weapon selection in flight.
	- Missiles and nukes will now properly play their explosion sound effects.
	- AI controlled turrets will no longer return to rest position when overheated/reloading.
	- Fix terminal heat guidance for missiles, including not being decoyed by flares.
	- Improve consistency of anti-radiation distance target check.
	- Add paramater gpsUpdates for GPS guided missiles. gpsUpdates >= 0 in the missile config will allow the missile to get position updates of the target from the craft that launched the missile (if it can still see the target) every gpsUpdates seconds.
	- Corrections to tracer placement and alignment at orbital speeds (for deep space combat).
		- Note: Enable "Vessel-Relative Bullet Checks" when at these speeds for correct collision checks between bullets and vessels. Disable it at lower speeds as it can be a CPU hog.
	- Fix delay/penetrating fuze rounds sometimes not detonating.
	- Penetrating rounds now register damage to all parts they hit, not just first.
	- Fix 'Weapon requires EC' message spam if active vessel is not the one with the weapon in question.
	- Weapons using ECPerShot now only drain ElectricCharge if the vessel has sufficient EC to fire the weapon.
	- Use the explosion models and sounds given in MissileLauncher if none are specified in BDAExplosivePart.
	- Adds Active Protection System implementation.
		- Adds new fields: 'isAPS = T/F', 'APSType = [ballistic, missile,omni]'.
		- Adds new Settings.cfg field 'APS_THRESHOLD = n' to set threshold bullet/rocket size for interception.
- Armor:
	- Adjusted post-penetration behavior of high velocity rounds, rounds now erode instead of slowing down at high velocities.
		- Multi-plate armor schemes now behave more realistically and will require more careful material selection and configuration.
		- Whipple shields for hypervelocity rounds are now viable and desirable. This behavior is however still very crude and does not qualitative match realistic behavior.
	- Adjusted stats for S-Glass and Kevlar materials to have realistic RHA equivalency.
		- Re-implemented Tate-Alekseevksy equation for low-ductility materials.
	- Added debug console output for armor penetration behavior. Now when Debug -> Armor is on, console will output armor penetration parameters.

	- Adds SelfSealingTanks/Firebottle options to Proc Part Tanks.
	- Bullets/explosions/etc now ignore flags.

		- [S] - Camera will autoswitch to vessel with highest score.
		- [D] - Camera will switch to furthest vessel from dogfight centroid.
	- Restore the precision of Vector2d persistent fields.

	- Add a check for requested extending already being satisfied.
	- Add terrain awareness to the pilot AI's waypoint fly-to direction.

	- Add Air/Ground target preference weighting to Target Priorities.
	- Make the extend toggle apply to air-to-air missiles as well as air-to-air guns.
	- Update the AI GUI help text for the current extending settings.
	- Make the AI GUI vertically resizable.
	- AI will now head to target's last known position if contact lost (out of sight range/angle/radar detection), with accuracy of predicted position decaying over time.
	- AI will now enable radars when guard mode enabled.
	- Add an altitude steer limiter to the pilot AI.
	- Apply user-defined steer limiters to roll.
	- Force VTOL AI to aim towards targets when trying to fire missiles (if it can't already fire the missile).
	- Add a PID auto-tuning mode:
		- The AI will use gradient descent to optimize the plane's ability to turn to a range of headings and stabilize in those directions.
		- The loss being minimized is ∫f(x,θ)dθ over the range θ ∈ (30°,120°) (using the midpoint Riemann sum), where f(x,θ) is ∫(δp²·(α+t²)/θ² + γ·δr²·(α+t)/100/θ)dt for the current PID values (x) and heading change (θ), where δp is the pointing error, δr is the roll error, α is the fast response relevance and γ is the roll relevance (which is automatically adjusted over time to balance the contribution from the pointing and roll errors).
		- Usage: Once the plane is airborne (and not in combat), enable auto-tuning and set the sliders to the desired values (the defaults are reasonable starting points and can be preset in the SPH; adjusting some of the sliders will restart the auto-tuning), then allow the auto-tuning to run until it stops automatically when the learning rate (LR) decreases to below 1e-3. The PID values will revert to those giving the lowest loss and these will be stored so they can be restored in the SPH.
		- Recommendations:
			1. Set the auto-tuning altitude and speed to those expected to be used in combat.
			2. Use 5-10x time-scaling.
			3. Avoid mountainous terrain.
			4. Tune without dynamic damping first and use the result as the starting point for dynamic damping with all the damping values set to the tuned static damping value and the dynamic damping factors set to 1.
			5. Since the PID values are (currently) being optimized for flying to fixed points, the tuned I value may not be optimal for moving targets in combat and a slightly larger I may be desirable.

	- Increase the HP of the combat seat to the same as a kerbal (500).
	- Add a time scaling option to the GamePlay section of the settings for speeding up/slowing down the game rate while competitions are active.
		- This does not affect the physics time-step, which remains at 0.02, but simply tries to make the in-game clock go faster with respect to a wall clock, so it should not affect the physics (if they're implemented correctly).
		- WARNING: This is likely to mess with any other mod that adjusts the time rate, e.g., TimeControl, if they're active at the same time.
		- WARNING: Consistency of the results (compared to running at normal speed) is not yet verified, but initial results look promising.
- Internal:

	- Add the off-by-one frame fix to ramming and missile guidance.
	- Add logic for planes in Follow mode for the period between taking off and reaching their min altitude.
	- Add unclamped values for the low- and high-speed steer limiters.
- Weapons:
	- Move finalFire checks into a single function that runs in AimAndFire during the FashionablyLate timing phase instead of being spread between Update and FixedUpdate.
	- Add check to AI when using a weapons group to grab the lead offset from a weapon that can fire (has ammo/not reloading/overheated/pointing at self), not merely the first weapon found.

- Fix cost of aluminum armor panels.
- Fueltanks will no longer randomly explode when shot.

	- Adjust the ballistic trajectory simulation time-step multiplier based on the distance to the target to give improved debug lines/targeting line visuals.
	- Armor Panels now use Armor Integrity instead of HP.
	- Nukes now support custom FX.
- AI:
	- Also avoid 0 altitude (terrain avoidance) for bodies without solid surfaces or oceans (i.e., Jool).
	- Reworked the integral component of the PID to work as an actual PID again:
		- The integral is no longer reset to 0 when the pitch error changes sign, nor decays with time.
		- The integral is now vector valued to account for coupling between the yaw and pitch axes due to roll and the individual pitch and yaw components are projected out from this integral.
		- The maximum contribution to the steering from the integral component is 1 (similar to the magnitude of the individual components before this change, but larger than the original 0.2 prior to the previous change).
		- The internal yaw damping factor is increased from 0.2 to 0.33 to keep the internal ratios between the axes consistent for each of the P, I and D components (1:0.33:0.1 for pitch:yaw:roll).
	- Use missile velocity vector for evasion instead of missile relative position to prevent turning into missiles when they are at close range. 
	- Use soonest time to closest approach instead of closest distance to select highest threat missile. 
	- Change closest approach point to ignore missile threats to 3 Blast Radius from 1.5 Blast Radius.

	- Remove arc length term from DLZ calculation for ground launched missiles (this was breaking VLS parts).

IMPROVEMENTS
	- Missile evasion:
		- Behavior changes to notch and dive against missiles, pull away before impact for heat seekers only (continuing to notch is more effective against radar missiles). Fix spinning in place behavior that had occurred occasionally.
		- Simplify entry conditions for missile evasion behavior (only occurs within threshold of when your craft is set to dispense chaff/flares regardless of whether it has chaff or flares onboard).
		- Proper throttle settings for chaffing vs flaring.
		- Add check if radar missiles are still boresighted towards craft as a condition to treat missiles as a threat.
	- Shift 'AimAndFireAtEndOfFrame' to occur during the FashionablyLate timing phase of FixedUpdate and rename it 'AimAndFire'. This synchronises firing with the physics instead of waiting until the scene is rendered. It also occurs before Krakensbane adjustments have been made.
	- Simplify target threat to either be 0 (not under attack) or 1 (under attack).
	- Make Kerbal Safety a slider instead of a toggle to allow disabling ejection from cockpits, but still have existing kerbalEVAs deploy parachutes.

	- Return a full list of incoming missiles sorted by distance in UpdateGuardViewScan instead of just the first found.
	- Convert 'under attack' and 'under fire' routines to maintain their state until 1s after last notification instead of simply resetting after a fixed period.
	- Adds Impulse/Gravitc functionality for ballistics/rockets/lasers
		- Adds some new configuration fields
			- impulseWeapon = foo //gun/laser will deal impulse instead of damage
			- Impulse = n //magnitude of impulse delivered per bullet/rocket/pulse laser shot, and impulse/sec delivered by beam lasers. setting this negative will make attractor lasers instead of repulsor lasers
			- graviticWeapon = foo //gun/laser will temporarily modify mass of hit part

		- Adds some new rocketdef config options
			- gravitic = foo //rocket will temporarily modify weight of parts hit by rocket and its explosion
			- impulse = foo //rocket applies non-damaging impulse to parts hit by rocket/explosion

	- Chernobyl bugfixes
	- Various NRE fixes

IMPROVEMENTS
	- Separate bullet movement and collision detection into separate functions. Detect collisions in the initial frame of a bullet so point blank shots work.

		- Added VIPs, which allow you to set up behavior such as guarding your VIP, or attacking enemy VIPs and ignoring craft defending them.
			- Add new "Is VIP" toggle to the weapons manager. Allows you to set a craft as a "VIP" which opens up new target priority options.
			- Added new target priority options "Protect My VIPs" and "Attack Enemy VIPs". Setting positive values on these sliders will result in the craft targeting enemies that are targeting VIPs on its own team, or attacking enemy VIPs, respectively.
		- Don't try to engage torpedoes with guns/missiles/lasers.
		- Use other weapons for ground targets if missiles fired is greater than or equal to max missiles on target setting.

	- Don't assign gender to spawned kerbals, let KSP do it.
	- Fix CheckSafeToFireGuns for debris preventing firing due to being too close to the target.
	- Reduced (but not eliminated) exceptions due to comet vessels.
	- Change the minimum damage amount of 0.01 to 0 as this was the cause of the fire damage over time applying despite the game being paused or slowed with time control.
	- Fix NREs in explosions from ClusterBomb.cs
	- Add KSP version dependent checks for part.IsKerbalEVA and crew.ResetInventory.
	- Updates Rocket targeting, fixes aimer alignment
	- Updates laser Infos with proper resource usage
IMPROVEMENTS
	UI and quality-of-life tweaks:
	- Add fault tolerance for missing bullet defs in GetInfo.
	- Add similar handing of missing or broken rocket info as for bullet info.
	- Move ConfigNode functions to their own translation unit.
	- Add 'Clear Debris Now' and 'Clear Bystanders Now' buttons to the Vessel Spawner window (in Spawn Options).
	- Option for using the old format of the Vessel Switcher window ('t'). Option for reassigning teams on spawn or retaining the original team name defined in the SPH. Right clicking 'T' in the Vessel Switcher window resets vessels to their original teams. Spawning from 'Folders' assigns the folder as the team name if team reassignment is enabled.
	- Remember position of RWR, Radar and TargetingCamera windows.
	- Add optional extra parameter to CreateExplosion to specify the weapon name (to be used for in-game messages for missile strikes).
	AI:

	- Fixed issues that were preventing AI from finishing the extending routine
	- Speed Adjusted Steer Limiter
	Spawning and Tournaments:
	- Teams options in the spawning and local tournament settings, including custom serialisation (doesn't support commas in craft file names) and UI adjustments.
	- Configure how seats are filled in the Vessel Spawner Window: minimal, all control points, also cabins. Crewed weapons always get filled with 1 crew.
	- Option to reset maxHitPoints on vessels loaded into flight mode (e.g., during spawning). Uses the MM patched value if available.
	- More consistent addition of _1, _2, etc., to vessel names which should make teams of the same vessel have valid results summaries in many cases without having to rename each craft (which is still a better solution!), not just the files.
	- Add RESULT line to competition log to indicate overall result of the competition (needed for teams).
	- Updated format of log files for teams. Updated tournament parsing script.
	- Add break-down of deaths (clean Bullets, clean Missiles, clean Rams, Assists, Suicides) and kills (Bullets, Missiles, Rams), and normalised death order and death time to the results summary.
	- Set KSP version of SpawnProbe to 1.9.0 to avoid issues with spawning on older installations.
	Kerbal Safety:
	- Move kerbal safety code from autonomous combat seat check in BDACompetition.cs to KerbalSafety.cs with its own toggle.
	- Free-falling kerbals deploy parachutes.
	- Kerbals in falling command seats leave the seat.
	- Vessels (and kerbals therein) are recovered during spawning instead of getting destroyed.
	- Surviving kerbals are recovered and immediately available for flying in the next competition instead of being MIA.
	- Ejection from cockpits is still a WIP.
	Battle Damage:
	- Battle damage is now configurable with multiple sub-categories, with the following toggles. Per-hit proc chance is also adjustable.
	- Fuel Tanks
		- FuelTanks will now leak when hit
		- Tanks may be configured to be self-sealing, trading some fuel capacity for leak resistance
		- Tank leak rate and leak duration can be adjusted
	- Ammo Boxes
		- Ammo boxes will potentially explode if hit
		- Ammo Boxes can be set to explode when destroyed
		- Adds ModuleCASE to ammo parts. Caselevel can be set from 0-2, higher levels reduce ammo explosion damage, at the cost of increased mass and cost.
	- Engines
		- Engine thrust reduced when hit, will start leaking fuel/catch fire/shut down when badly damaged
		- Intakes performance reduced when hit
		- Engine Gimbals can fail when hit
	- Wings
		- Wing damage per hit reduced
		- Wing lift loss capped at 50% total lift
		- Wing damage per hit is now configurable
		- Ailerons can fail when hit
	- Subsystems
		- Subsystem components
		- SAS/Radar/etc can be disabled when hit
	- Command
		- Control damage when hit
		- Pilots can be killed from cockpit damage
	- Fires - if a tank is leaking fuel, chance for leak to ignite
		- Fire damage over time
		- Fires in cockpits or other crewed or crew adjacent parts will be automatically extinguished.
		- Adds ModuleSelfSealingTank, can be toggled to prevent tanks leaks until tank receives substantial damage. it also adds the ability to configure fueltanks and engines to carry firebottles to extinguish fires
	RCS:
	- Improved RCS calculation accuracy and speed, your craft's RCS may be slightly different from 1.4.0.7
	- Recalculate RCS occasionally when parts are lost (to account for damage or missiles firing)
	- Fix engine afterburner textures affecting RCS calculation (was an issue for Tiger and Cheetah engines from AirplanePlus)
	Missiles:
	- New variables that affect heat seeking missile performance: lockedSeekerFOVBias, and lockedSeekerVelocityBias. See Sidewinder config file for more details.
	- Fixed allAspect and maxOffBoresight to work as intended. Vertical launch systems (VLS) and high off-boresight missiles should work as intended. See AIM-120 config file for details.
	- Add ability for Air-to-Ground missiles to lead targets based on their velocity.
	- Fixed Dynamic Launch Zone calculation, should result in more close-range missile fires and high off-boresight missiles only firing when they are likely to hit their target.
	- Better explanation of what missile parameters do added to Sidewinder and AIM-120 config files (new heat seeker value description in Sidewinder config file).
	- Updated torpedo tuning from Kurgan.
	Target Priority:
	- Target acceleration target priority now returns TWR/10 instead of instantaneous acceleration/10. Is set to -1 when target craft loses engines.
	- Less teammates engaging target priority now returns -1 when all teammates are engaging the same target instead of 0 (allows for better ganging up on the same target).
	Parts:
	- New armor panels, rescaled armor panel part mass, cost, HP to scale properly based on size.
	- Remove AIM-4 missiles, are moved to the Flying Circus mod for now, planned to be re-released in a future BDA expansion mod.
	- Added new Typhoon engine to fill the gap between Juno and Panther.
	Effects:
	- New FireFX effect

	- Improvements to RCS/stealth/ECM:
		- Craft with a lower modified radar signature (from ECM Modules that reduce signature) no longer have increased lock range. The range at which craft are locked will be accurate based on the RCS Window in the SPH/VAB if no jammers are used.
		- Re-worked RCS system. Calculate 95 azimuth/elevation pairs across 0-180 deg Az, 23 to -23 deg El, take the 3rd quartile of the distribution to use as the total RCS.
		- Scale RCS up by 4 to better match reality and provide better balancing against stock radars.
		- Display worst three Az/El pairs in the BDA editor window so that users can improve their design.
		- Fix to turn on all ECM jammers when an incoming radar-missile is detected.
	- Improvements to missiles:
		- Allow firing multiple missiles at the same radar target without losing radar lock. Firing missiles at multiple locked targets needs considerable work to be feasible.
		- Fix known issues with terminal guidance.
		- Add option for configuring FireFOV of a turret (fires when pointing within this angle of target). Reduce step size of fire interval to 0.5s.
	- Improvements to pilot AI:
		- Allow users to set "Firing Angle," the angle the weapons are within of being on target before firing. Default is 1 deg. Setting is on Weapons Manager. Setting only affects weapons with a yaw and pitch range of less than 5 degrees for both axes.
		- Make wing commander 'spread' and 'lag' values persistent.
		- Allow pilots in the "Attack" command to evade if they are being fired at by another craft
		- Sliders for controlling threshold and period of collision avoidance between vessels.
		- Allow craft to evade if they are under attack while being commanded to "Attack."
	- UI improvements:
		- Improved behaviour for entering spawn coordinates and altitude.
		- Add a slider in tournament settings to control delay between heats.
	- Other improvements:

	- Reduce max fireBurstLength to 10 and stepIncrement to 0.05 to allow more control of gun burst length.
	- Updated HP patch from CeruleanEyes

v1.3.8
FIXES

		- Fixed decals not being returned to the object pool so that they work efficiently now.
	Other fixes:
		- Use the correct spawn distance value in the remote orchestration.
		- Unity's fake nulls strike again: properly reset explosion object pools on scene changes.
		- KSP is labelling some missiles as debris. Detect these and don't remove them.
		- Bugfixes, memory leak fixes and optimisations.
		- Don't use Parallel.ForEach to update ramming information as Unity doesn't like get_transform being called from threads.
		- Assign font attributes in Awake instead of Constructor.
		- Fix potential NRE in ApplyDamage in PooledBullet.cs
		- Fix a potential NRE in continuous spawning where a spawned vessel gets destroyed before it's activated.
		- Fix special case of vessels with combat seats getting renamed.
		- Reset spawn position and rotation after spawning as sometimes KSP packs and unpacks craft and resets things!
		- Wait an extra update during spawning to allow reference transforms to be assigned.
		- Use altitudes from FlightGlobals when raycasting fails during spawning.
IMPROVEMENTS
	Main improvements:
		- Rebalance of explosion damage from bullets to approximate the previous DPS of the browning, vulcan and gau-8.
		- AI/WM now cost 0.
	Other improvements:

		- Set up paintball decal pools when the paintball toggle is toggled.
		- Extra damage sliders in-game
		- Small optimisation to avoid reallocating Ray instance in PooledBullet.cs
		- Add the explModelPath to the browninganm2.cfg
		- Use a split slider for tournament rounds setting to allow up to 100 rounds.
		- Reuse deathOrder variable instead of fetching it from BDACompetitionMode.Instance again.
		- Use minSpeed instead of idleSpeed in steer limiter. Scale possibleAccel by 1/15 as before (but without G) for now until we find a better solution.
		- Additional regular check for vessels renamed as planes due to the combat seat.
		- Automatically end a continuous spawning competition when there's nothing left to spawn and <2 active craft.
		- Add a max altitude GM killer.
		- Updated Python scripts for parsing competition results logs.
		- Also trigger competition end when there's only 1 team left.
		- Include engine acceleration but not gravity in GetSteerLimiterForSpeedAndPower as it makes gliders and RegainEnergy work better.
		- Use afterburners when regaining energy.
		- Trigger the target scan after all the teams have been assigned.
		- Enable target priority by default.
		- Stop extending when changing targets.
		- Include death time and normalised death order in web orchestration reporting with surviving player death order/time set to max

v1.3.6.3
FIXES
	- Don't autodestruct missiles if the explosive parts are using the override.
	- Show message about why the vessel spawning timed out.
	- Prevent windows from being competely off-screen (the drag region may still be off-screen though). Toggling "Strict Window Boundaries" will bring all the windows onto the screen if you can't find them.
IMPROVEMENTS
	- Absolute Distance vs Distance Factor toggle and expanded Spawn Distance slider for ranges up to 20km. (Note: for distances over 10km, it struggles due to the PRE and terrain. Using an airborne spawn first can help fix this.)
	- Add 'Detonate At Minimum Distance' to MMG. (Note: MMG doesn't have an 'ignore friendlies' yet.)
	- Add 'Detonate At Minimum Distance' for explosive parts too.
		- Note: the effect of 'Detonate At Minimum Distance' is to delay the detonation/triggering once it's within the detonation radius until the distance is minimised.

v1.3.6.2
FIXES

v1.0.0

* NEW FEATURES:

  * Radar & Stealth, re-design of how the radar system works:
	- New radar reflection shader (credit: original great idea by JR!), calculating cross section in m^2:
	   + allows building for stealth using angled surfaces (“scatter those pesky radar waves away!”)
	   + calculation is normalized so that a 1x1 structural plate directly frontally facing the radar yields a return of exactly 1 m^2
	- Redesign of the radar system, radars all have different ranges & detection performance:
	   + radar part configs changed, new fields (floatcurves) to define detection and lock/track performance, new field to specify ground clutter effectiveness
	- New in-editor analysis window to help evaluate a craft’s cross section and performance against selectable radars
	- New options for configuration of radar guided missiles in the part config:
	   + can now explicitly specify active seeker performance (via a FloatCurve, similar to radars)
	   + can now explicitly specify the static radar cross section of a missile for detection purpose
	- Adjustment of the Chaff countermeasure system: more gradual effect of decoying missiles away (instead of previous “all-or-nothing”)
	- Adjustment of IR missiles and flare countermeasures: simulating now more of a “imaging infrared” seeker than an old dumb seeker – to be successfully decoyed, flares have to more closely match the thermal spectrum of the part the seeker has locked on to

  * Massive improvements to ballistic missile guidance and modular missiles, ability to simulate ICBM flight paths:
	- Ballistic guidance has been enhanced to allow firing missiles accurately even at distances greater than 500 km
	- A new field called BallisticOverShootFactor has been added to missiles, the greater the value the further the missile will go before the terminal maneuver begins
	- By default all missiles now can steer in vacuum. New field called "vacuumSteerable" can be set to false to disable this behaviour    
	- Auto SAS activation when the missile is fired. Before it was only activated if the parent vessel had it switched on.
	- Improved the Cruise and Ballistic Guidance. Ballistic Guidance will switch to AGM guidance as soon as it reached the 50% of the distance
	- Guard mode in space will consider orbiting vessels as "flying" (air targets), hence engagement of space targets is possible now
 
  * New dedicated sonar ping and torpedo ping sounds, courtesy of PapaJoe!

* FIXES / ENHANCEMENTS:

  * Localization updates, including chinese localization (thanks @ACEA)
  * Fixed indestructible Kerbals - weapons/explosions have effect on Kerbals again! (thanks @Designer225)
  * Fixed AIPilot problem with drag estimations (thanks @RichardDastardly)
  * Fix missile infinite fuel
  * Fix rwr window invisible in fresh installs
  * Display ranges of RWR and radar display now linked, selectable display range of radar display up to configured PRE physics max range!
  * Window position saving also for vesselswitcher
  * Prevent active radar missiles locking onto anything they see, now obey engagement settings
  * Sonar pings and torpedos only show on RWR if vessel is splashed/submerged
  * Fix guard mode "cheating" - now must have detected an enemy with radar/sonar or with visual range before it can attack it
  * If a cruise missile has terminal guidance, it can be switched off (before launch) in the part action window. The missile will then be purely gps guided without engaging its terminal targeting mode
  * If debug labels are enabled, upon entering the editor all bda parts & their properties (if relevant for balancing) are dumped into .csv files for convenient analysis in excel
  * Complete review of all event handlers, should reduce some actual or potential nullrefs upon explosive vessel disassembly
  * General performance improvements due to code refactoring

* New Parts

	* Courtesy of SpannerMonkey 
		- BDA MK1 Sonar Pod
		- Sting Ray  BDA LightWeight Torpedo
		
* Notes on Naval Combat Features

	* Current implementation of "Sonar" reuses the current Radar code. Future state will have dedicated windows and naming convention
	* Activating a "Sonar" pod still says "Activate Radar"
	* A Sonar is defined by setting the rwrThreatType = 6
		- Sonar rules
			- Will only detect vessels that are underwater (> 20meters)
			- Sonar will not function if vessel is in flight
			- Sonar does not detect "Landed" vessels, only splashed
			- Normal Radar does not detect underwater vessels, still detects "Splashed" i.e. Boats
	* Engagment type "SLW" only targets underwater (submarines) and Splashed (Boats)

v0.2.0.0
= New features=
- Modular Missile Guidance:
	A full rewrite of this part has been done. Now you can build your own missiles, define all its parameters,
	even its name. And it will be used by the AI as if it was a stock BDArmory missile!

	If you want to know more about this new feature, you can download a custom part pack for procedural missiles:
	https://github.com/jrodrigv/BDModularMissileParts
	And read this wiki
	https://github.com/jrodrigv/BDModularMissileParts/wiki/1.-Building-your-first-Modular-Missile

- Proximity Fuse for Missiles: 
	A new field called "detonation distance override" has been added to missiles.
